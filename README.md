# TTR Sales Revenue Improvement Analysis

## Overview
This project presents a detailed analysis aimed at identifying strategies to enhance the revenue of The Tea Room (TTR), a chain of tea rooms across The Netherlands. The analysis, structured in three parts, dives deep into the sales data to uncover patterns and opportunities for revenue improvement.

## Dataset Overview
The analysis utilizes a dataset provided by TTR, containing sales data with variables such as transaction IDs, dates, quantities, store locations, unit prices, product categories, and types. This data forms the foundation for a statistical examination focused on understanding sales dynamics and identifying revenue enhancement strategies.

## Key Findings & Recommendations
The analysis led to several actionable insights:

1. **Product Categories and Revenue**: Certain product categories, notably Chocolate and Coffee, significantly outperform others in revenue generation. Expanding the range and visibility of these categories is recommended.

2. **Tea Room Location Strategy**: Despite the lack of statistically significant differences in revenue by location, optimizing operational efficiency based on revenue performance at each location could enhance overall profitability.

3. **Leveraging Sales Patterns**: The analysis uncovered significant variances in daily revenues, with weekends showing higher sales. Implementing weekday specials and optimizing staffing and inventory for busier days are advised to even out revenue streams.

## Analysis Approach
- **Descriptive Analysis**: Examined sales data to understand central tendencies, variation, and distribution across different categories and locations.
- **Inferential Analysis**: Employed hypothesis testing (ANOVA) to assess the statistical significance of observed differences in revenue across product categories, locations, and days of the week.
